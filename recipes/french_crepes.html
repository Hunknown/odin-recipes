    <p>A crêpe or crepe is a very thin type of pancake. Crêpes are usually one of two varieties: sweet crêpes (crêpes sucrées) or savoury galettes (crêpes salées). They are often served with a wide variety of fillings such as cheese, fruit, vegetables, meats, and a variety of spreads. Crêpes can also be flambéed, such as in crêpes Suzette. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cr%C3%AApe">Wikipedia</a></p>

    <h2 class="ingredients">Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon white sugar</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>3 eggs</li>
        <li>2 cups milk</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons butter, melted</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="steps">Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Sift flour, sugar, and salt into a bowl; set aside. Beat eggs and milk together in a large bowl with an electric mixer. Beat in flour mixture until smooth; stir in melted butter.</li>
        <li>Lightly grease a griddle or frying pan; heat over medium-high heat.</li>
        <li>Pour or scoop the batter onto the griddle, using approximately 2 tablespoons for each crêpe. Immediately rotate the skillet to spread batter out in a thin layer. Cook until the top of the crêpe is no longer wet and the bottom has turned light brown, 1 to 2 minutes. Shake the pan or loosen with a spatula; turn or flip it over and cook until other side has turned light brown, about 1 minute more. Repeat with remaining batter.</li>
